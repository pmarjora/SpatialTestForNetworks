# SpatialTestForNetworks

This is code to help begin exploring the idea of pathway analyses that are robust to pathway definitions.
Our plan is to use methods to detect spatial clustering within the "super-network" formed by taking the superset of all networks.
We then plan to use methods for detecting spatial custering, such as Moran's-I and LISA.
